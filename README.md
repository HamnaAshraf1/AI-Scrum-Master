## Overview:
Despite Agile being the default methodology for 85% of North American respondents, the agile culture score is only 32%, indicating significant room for improvement. McKinsey research highlights the benefits of Agile, with 93% of Agile organizations reporting better customer satisfaction and operational performance, and 76% improved employee engagement. However, Agile culture is not practiced due to a lack of understanding and training on Agile principles among staff. Proper implementation of Agile can enhance project visibility, accelerate time to market, and improve stakeholder satisfaction. \
We want to increase the Agile adoption across organizations. Therefore, we came up with the solution of introducing smart AI Scrum Master that will perform the following:
- **Create list of tasks for members:**\
  Automatically generate Todo list for all members based on plan meeting discussions and integrates with your product management tool, such as Jira, Trello etc.
  
- **Conduct daily scrum meeting:**\
  Organize daily stand-up meetings as scheduled, generate synchronized messages and summaries based on the meeting discussion, and automatically update the project management system. It ensures that meeting is time   bound (15 minutes), everyone answers 3 questions and irrevelant details are not discussed.

- **Backlog Management:**\
  The project backlog is managed by the Scrum Master. It will ensure that the tickets are updated and completed before the deadline.
